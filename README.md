## Features 🎯

- **Interactive UI** for inputting car details such as brand, year of manufacture, mileage, etc.
- Predicts car prices using a **pre-trained machine learning model**.
- Includes dropdowns, sliders, and buttons for a user-friendly experience.
- Supports car brands, fuel types, and other categorical variables seamlessly.

## Cardetails.csv Dataset 📊

The Cardetails.csv file is a dataset containing comprehensive details about various cars, which is utilized for training the machine learning model and populating dropdown options in the web application.

Key Features in the Dataset
The dataset includes the following columns:

- **1. name**:

- The brand or make of the car (e.g., Maruti, Hyundai, Honda).
- This is further processed to extract the brand name.

- **2. year**:

- The year of manufacture of the car.
- Used to calculate the car's age.

- **3. km_driven**:

- The total number of kilometers driven by the car.
- Helps estimate the wear and tear on the vehicle.

- **4. fuel**:

- The type of fuel the car uses (e.g., Petrol, Diesel, LPG, CNG).
- **5. seller_type**:

- Indicates whether the seller is an Individual, Dealer, or Trustmark Dealer.

- **6. transmission**:

- Specifies whether the car has a Manual or Automatic transmission.

- **7. owner**:

- The number of previous owners (e.g., First Owner, Second Owner, etc.).

- **8. mileage**:

- The car's mileage in kilometers per liter (kmpl).

- **9. engine**:

- The engine capacity of the car in cubic centimeters (cc).

- **10. max_power**:

- The maximum power output of the car, usually in brake horsepower (bhp).

- **11. seats**:

- The number of seats available in the car.
